# Meta Learning Synaptic Plasticity
This repository is written in `JAX`, and contains the codebase for experiments on meta-learning synaptic plasticity rules in deep neural networks. The goal is to use such an approach to meta-learn
plasticity rules in different compartments of the mushroom body of the fly brain, using experimental data and connectomic constraints.
