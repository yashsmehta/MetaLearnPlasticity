ðŸ§ ðŸª° Learning Synaptic Plasticity
==========
This code is built on [**JAX**](https://github.com/google/jax), aiming to learn synaptic plasticity rules from neuronal or behavioral data with an in-silico model of the fly. Plasticity rules are parameterized by a MLP or a Taylor expansion, whose parameters are updated by using backpropagation through time.
To get started:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
